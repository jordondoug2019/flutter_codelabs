# flutter_codelabs

I started my tech journey with an interest in building mobile apps. So I'm back where I started and I'm teaching myself Flutter. My goal is to complete every codelab on the Flutter tutorial site.

# CodeLab #1 

In CodeLab #1, I created a Namer App. A simple app that generates random WordPairs. In this CodeLab, I learned the following:
1. Structure a project
2. Create a project
3. Create a Stateless Widget
4. Design the UI using Colors, Columns, rows
5. Adding a Button
6. Create a List
7. Stateless vs Stateful Widget

# CodeLab #2
